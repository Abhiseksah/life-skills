1) **What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?**  
   Sexual harassment can stem from behavior that crosses personal or physical boundaries, including inappropriate comments, sexual advances, unwanted physical touch, and suggestive remarks. Examples include complimenting someone's appearance in a way that makes them uncomfortable, making jokes or comments of a sexual nature, or testing personal interest in a colleague without their consent. These actions can create a hostile work environment.

2) **What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?**  
   If you face or witness harassment, the first step is to clearly tell the person to stop. If the behavior doesn’t stop or if you’re uncomfortable confronting them directly, report the incident using your organization's grievance procedure. This could involve speaking with a supervisor, HR, or someone else you trust. It's important to follow up with the proper channels to prevent retaliation and ensure the issue is addressed.
3) **What Does Bullying and Harassment Mean for You and Your Workplace?**

   Bullying and harassment create a hostile work environment, leading to stress, anxiety, and reduced performance for you. For the workplace, it lowers morale, productivity, and increases turnover. It’s essential to foster a respectful and supportive environment.

4) **Explains different scenarios enacted by actors.**  
   - **Testing Boundaries:** A manager tests a subordinate’s interest by making personal remarks, leading to an uncomfortable shift in their relationship. While the manager might not intend harm, this creates an awkward and strained dynamic.  
   - **Unwanted Physical Contact:** An employee feels uncomfortable with a colleague’s physical affection, like unsolicited hugs, which are not welcome by everyone, even if others seem to accept it.  
   - **Repeated Advances Despite Rejection:** An individual continues to push for a date or a personal interaction after being told no, demonstrating persistent and unwanted attention, which crosses boundaries.

5) **How to handle cases of harassment?**  
   - **Immediate Action:** The first step is to ask the person to stop if you feel comfortable doing so.  
   - **Report to Authorities:** If the behavior continues, escalate the issue by following the company’s reporting procedures—inform your supervisor, HR, or a trusted person in authority.  
   - **Confidentiality and No Retaliation:** Organizations should ensure confidentiality and protect against retaliation when complaints are made, fostering a safe environment for employees to report incidents.

6) **How to behave appropriately?**  
   - **Respect Boundaries:** Always be mindful of personal space and avoid physical contact unless you are certain it is welcome. Comments or actions should never be sexually suggestive.  
   - **Empathy and Awareness:** Understand that what may seem like harmless behavior to you could be perceived differently by others. Be aware of signals like discomfort or hesitation from colleagues.  
   - **Professionalism:** Keep all interactions professional and focus on work-related matters. Avoid any comments or actions that could create a sexually charged or uncomfortable atmosphere.  
   - **Consider the Golden Rule:** Ask yourself if you would feel comfortable saying or doing the same thing in front of a loved one. If not, don’t do it in the workplace.
