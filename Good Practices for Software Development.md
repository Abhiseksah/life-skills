#### **Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**  
The importance of over-communicating in group channels instead of private DMs was a new and useful insight. It highlights how visibility helps the entire team stay aligned and minimizes the risk of missing critical updates. Additionally, the idea of joining meetings a few minutes early to build rapport with teammates was an interesting point I hadn't considered before.  

#### **Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**  
I need to improve on managing distractions and maintaining 100% involvement during work hours. Often, social media and notifications disrupt my flow. To address this:  
- I’ll use tools like **Freedom** or **TimeLimit** to block distracting apps during work hours.  
- I'll put my phone on silent and only enable notifications for work-related apps.  
- I’ll create a strict schedule with dedicated time for **deep work**, ensuring I focus on one task at a time without multitasking.  
- I’ll also make sure to balance meals and incorporate daily exercise to sustain energy levels throughout the day.
