## Q1) What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
 The Feynman Technique is a learning strategy that involves simplifying a concept as if teaching it to someone else, helping to uncover and address knowledge gaps.

## Q2)In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
 The most interesting story in the Video is about how the speaker went from struggling with math and science in school to becoming a professor of engineering. She explains how, after her time in the military where she worked as a Russian translator, she realized she wanted to learn math and science, despite having no background in them. She decided to change her brain and approach learning differently, ultimately becoming passionate about learning and teaching. This transformation led her to research effective learning techniques, connecting with top professors and experts in neuroscience to understand how the brain works when learning new things.

## Q3)What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
 the active (focus) mode is when you concentrate on a specific task or concept, thinking deeply and closely about it. This mode is useful for solving problems that require focused attention and familiar patterns.

 The diffused mode is a more relaxed state of thinking, where your mind is less focused, allowing for broader thinking and the creation of new ideas. In this mode, the brain makes connections and gains new perspectives that might not be apparent in the focused mode. Both modes work together to enhance learning and problem-solving.

## Q4)According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
 Steps to Take When Approaching a New Topic

1. **Deconstruct the skill**: Break down the skill into smaller, manageable parts to focus on the most important aspects first.
2. **Learn enough to self-correct**: Gather a few resources to help you understand the basics and self-correct as you practice.
3. **Remove barriers to practice**: Eliminate distractions and create an environment that encourages uninterrupted practice.
4. **Commit to practicing for at least 20 hours**: Stick to a 20-hour practice schedule to push through the initial frustration and see real improvement.

## Q5)What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

Here are 5 key actions to improve your learning process:

1. **Full Focus and Deep Work**: Engage fully with programming and limit distractions by using tools to block social media and notifications.

2. **Master Key Concepts**: Understand, apply, and explain concepts in your own words, and implement them in code.

3. **Set Deadlines**: Use deadlines to manage time, but focus more on mastering the concept than just completing tasks.

4. **Personalize Learning**: Make the learning process enjoyable by customizing it to your style and practicing it in your own way.

5. **Proactive Communication**: Communicate obstacles and progress clearly, and complete work on time with clear, precise implementation.
